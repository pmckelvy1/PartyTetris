## Details

The logic of PartyTetris is handled in javascript.  The styling is designed in CSS, and rendered in javascript using the jQueryLite library.  The color-wheel styling is a custom javascript algorithm built to cycle through a specific set of colors continuously, and attach to a block when it is dropped.
